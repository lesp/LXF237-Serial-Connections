These files are used to test serial connections between a micro:bit and a Raspberry Pi

To use the files you will need

* A Raspberry Pi running Raspbian
* [Mu installed on the Pi](https://codewith.mu/)
* A micro:bit and micro USB lead

In Mu, copy and paste the code contained in **shaker.py**, connect the micro:bit to the Pi via USB and then upload / flash the code to the micro:bit.
Leave the micro:bit attached to the Pi.

On the Pi open your favourite Python3 editor (Thonny, IDLE, VIM) and open Pi-Test.py.
Run the code and you shake the micro:bit.
You will see the serial data in the Python shell.

Now go and do something fun with it!
